       <p2>The Western Cape transport department on Thursday called the SA National Taxi Council (Santaco) to an urgent meeting regarding extortion in some sectors of the taxi industry.

        The province's Transport MEC Daylin Mitchell said:
        
        My office has been inundated with complaints from victims of extortion, such as private companies and owners, whose vehicles are being stopped by elements within the taxi industry [so-called patrollers], who impose 'fines' or 'release fees' on people when they drive in certain communities.
        "These crimes are allegedly aligned to both the [Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association] and the [Congress of Democratic Taxi Association]," he said.</p2>
